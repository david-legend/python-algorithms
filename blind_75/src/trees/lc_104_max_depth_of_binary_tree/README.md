# [LC 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree - Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.  

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2


```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```


### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
