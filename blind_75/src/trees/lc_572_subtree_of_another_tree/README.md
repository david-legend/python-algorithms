# [LC 572. Subtree of Another Tree - Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/description/)

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.  

A subtree of a binary tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.  
### Example 1

![Subtree of Another Tree Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree1-tree.jpg)  

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

### Example 2 

![Subtree of Another Tree Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```


### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
- The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4
