# [LC 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).



### Example 1

![Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)  


```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```


### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
