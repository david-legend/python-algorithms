# [LC 450. Delete Node in a BST - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.  

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:  

- Search for a node to remove.
- If the node is found, delete the node.

### Example 1

![Delete Node in a BST Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)  

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

### Example 2 

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

### Example 3
```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- Each node has a unique value.
- root is a valid binary search tree.
- -10^5 <= key <= 10^5
