# [LC 654. Maximum Binary Tree - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/description/)


You are given an integer array nums with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from nums using the following algorithm:  

- Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.
- Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
- Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.

Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.  

### Example 1

![Maximum Binary Tree Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/tree1.jpg)  

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]
Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].
        - Empty array, so no child.
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].
            - Empty array, so no child.
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.
        - Empty array, so no child.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,null,2,null,1]
```


### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- All integers in nums are unique.
