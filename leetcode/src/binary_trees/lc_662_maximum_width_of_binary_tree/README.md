# [LC 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.  

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.  

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.  

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
