# [LC 98. Recover Binary Search Tree - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/description/)

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.


### Example 1

![Recover Binary Search Tree Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)  


```
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

### Example 2

![Recover Binary Search Tree Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg) 

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```


### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
- -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1



- Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant O(1) space solution?
