# [LC 152. Maximum Product Subarray - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

 
### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
