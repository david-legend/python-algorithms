# [LC 336. Palindrome Pairs - Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/description/)

You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.

A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:

- 0 <= i, j < word.length,
- i != j, and
- words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome string.  

Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of word

### Example 1

```
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: words = ["a",""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]
```


### Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 5000
- 0 <= words[i].length <= 300
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters
