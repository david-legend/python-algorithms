# Fibonacci numbers

Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 

First few Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …

Mathematically we can define the Fibonacci numbers as:

    Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), for n > 1

    Given that: Fib(0) = 0, and Fib(1) = 1
