# Dutch National Flag Problem (medium) ✩

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we can’t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: 
red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of 
three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

### Example 1
Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]


### Example 2
Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2,]
