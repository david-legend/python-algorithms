# Sliding Window Median (hard)✩

Given an array of numbers and a number ‘k’, find the median of all the ‘k’ sized sub-arrays (or windows) of the array.

### Example 1:

Input: nums=[1, 2, -1, 3, 5], k = 2
Output: [1.5, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0]
Explanation: Lets consider all windows of size ‘2’:

[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 1.5
[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 0.5
[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 1.0
[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 4.0

### Example 2:

Input: nums=[1, 2, -1, 3, 5], k = 3
Output: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
Explanation: Lets consider all windows of size ‘3’:

[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 1.0
[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 2.0
[1, 2, -1, 3, 5] -> median is 3.0
