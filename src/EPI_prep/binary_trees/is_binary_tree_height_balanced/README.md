# Is Binary Tree Height Balanced

* Write a program that takes as input the root of a binary tree and checks whether the tree is height- balanced.

A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for each node in the tree, 
the difference in the height of its left and right subtrees is at most one. 
A perfect binary tree is height-balanced, as is a complete binary tree. 
A height-balanced binary tree does not have to be perfect or complete.
