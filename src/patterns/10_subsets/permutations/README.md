# Permutations (medium) ✩

Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set. For example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:

1. {1, 2, 3}
2. {1, 3, 2}
3. {2, 1, 3}
4. {2, 3, 1}
5. {3, 1, 2}
6. {3, 2, 1}

If a set has ‘n’ distinct elements it will have n!n! permutations.

### Example 1
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: [1,3,5], [1,5,3], [3,1,5], [3,5,1], [5,1,3], [5,3,1]
