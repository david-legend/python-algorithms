# Bitonic Array Maximum (easy) ✩

Find the maximum value in a given Bitonic array. An array is considered bitonic 
if it is monotonically increasing and then monotonically decreasing. 
Monotonically increasing or decreasing means that for any index i in the array arr[i] != arr[i+1].

### Example 1
Input: [1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]
Output: 12
Explanation: The maximum number in the input bitonic array is '12'.

### Example 2
Input: [3, 8, 3, 1]
Output: 8

### Example 3
Input: [1, 3, 8, 12]
Output: 12

### Example 4
Input: [10, 9, 8]
Output: 10
