# 'K' Closest Points to the Origin (easy) ✩

Given an array of points in a 2D plane, find ‘K’ closest points to the origin.

### Example 1
Input: points = [[1,2],[1,3]], K = 1
Output: [[1,2]]
Explanation: The Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and the origin is sqrt(5).
The Euclidean distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
Since sqrt(5) < sqrt(10), therefore (1, 2) is closer to the origin.

### Example 2
Input: point = [[1, 3], [3, 4], [2, -1]], K = 2
Output: [[1, 3], [2, -1]]
