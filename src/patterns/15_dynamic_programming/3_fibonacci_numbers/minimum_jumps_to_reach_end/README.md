# Minimum jumps to reach the end

Given an array of positive numbers, where each element represents the max number of jumps 
that can be made forward from that element, write a program to find the minimum number of 
jumps needed to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). 
If an element is 0, then we cannot move through that element.

### Example 1:
Input = {2,1,1,1,4}
Output = 3
Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the last index through: 0->2->3->4

### Example 2:
Input = {1,1,3,6,9,3,0,1,3}
Output = 4
Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the last index through: 0->1->2->3->8
