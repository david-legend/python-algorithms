# Smallest Subarray With a Greater Sum (easy) ✩

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest contiguous 
subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.


### Example 1
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].

### Example 2
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7 
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [8].

### Example 3
Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8 
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].
