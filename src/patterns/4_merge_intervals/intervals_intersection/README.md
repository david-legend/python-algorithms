# Intervals Intersection (medium) ✩

Given two lists of intervals, find the intersection of these two lists. 
Each list consists of disjoint intervals sorted on their start time.


#### Example 1
Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], arr2=[[2, 3], [5, 7]]
Output: [2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 7]
Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.

#### Example 2
Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]], arr2=[[5, 10]]
Output: [5, 7], [9, 10]
Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.
