# Maximum CPU Load (hard) ✩

We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, 
and a CPU load when it is running. Our goal is to find the 
maximum CPU load at any time if all the jobs are running on the same machine.


#### Example 1
Jobs: [[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since [1,4,3] and [2,5,4] overlap, their maximum CPU load (3+4=7) will be when both the 
jobs are running at the same time i.e., during the time interval (2,4).

#### Example 2
Jobs: [[6,7,10], [2,4,11], [8,12,15]]
Output: 15
Explanation: None of the jobs overlap, therefore we will take the maximum load of any job which is 15.


#### Example 3
Jobs: [[1,4,2], [2,4,1], [3,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum CPU load will be 8 as all jobs overlap during the time interval [3,4].
