# Find the Corrupt Pair (easy) ✩

We are given an unsorted array containing ‘n’ numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. 
The array originally contained all the numbers from 1 to ‘n’, 
but due to a data error, one of the numbers got duplicated 
which also resulted in one number going missing. Find both these numbers.

#### Example 1
Input: [3, 1, 2, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: '2' is duplicated and '4' is missing.

#### Example 2
Input: [3, 1, 2, 3, 6, 4]
Output: [3, 5]
Explanation: '3' is duplicated and '5' is missing.
