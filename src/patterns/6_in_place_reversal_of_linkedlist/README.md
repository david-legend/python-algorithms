# Introduction

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. 
Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, 
i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above problem.
